scores on that row. 2 pts
9. Required: Once a user has entered their last hole's score, give them a message that shows them their total
 score relative to par (+5, -10, etc) and a few words describing their score (i.e., positive score: "Better luck 
 next time", negative score: "On to the PGA!") No alerts please. 2 pts
 10. Required: Use the golf data API to bring in the data for the golf course(s). 2 pts
